# ArchiveNetworker
Archive_Scraper runs against the Data directory and must follow the path pattern "Data/[subject]/[location]" along with
the run parameters --subject [subject] --location [location]
The output subdirectories will also need to be available for the Machine Learning ingestion including ./[data] and ./[images]
Add to environment TESSDATA_PREFIX and TESSERACT_PATH for the AI Tesseract OCR module to find the models and program path.

To obtain the graph data run the graphai.py to extract the directed spreadsheet that can be used for network analysis.

--- The Covenant of Nagasaki ---
If there ever is anything worth leaving behind when I leave this earth. Is the account of an old women, almost 119 years of age. We found her in a quiet remote home not far from Nagasaki.
A pilgrimage of one soul whose name they called Sarsen would have asked her of this legendary tale that rumours stirred around the town. As he comes to an old tree to gather shade he sits, hopeless and lost to everything of the world today. As the leafy dust drew in a final breadth, out from the tree she comes to a vision and seats herself across an old giant whose trunk she made place.
Are you the young man my daughter told me about seeking the Covid?
Oh my god, replied Sarsen. You can not believe how many mountains, hills, forests and laneways I have searched for the  Covid of legend. I have read the sands, dirt, walls and wood, to have at last followed the trail here where the clues last showed grace.
Ah, yess. You must be after the twin stars who left a Covid blaze, I heard a tale something of the same, in another town. But the one I will never forget is a witness to a vision I had never been able to replace.
I was a young girl in August 1945, a lovely blue lit sunny day I remembered it well. Where I followed my regular walk to a bustling market gardens of Nagasaki. I came to the sound of crying kitten which drew me closer, crossing the colours of fruits and greenary to a drainage opening where I pulled myself in. There it was, "stupid cat, you know this place is not safe". I gently held the poor kitten and made my way to try get back to the surface. I had almost stuck my head out into the glearing light of the sun.
To which I froze in reaction to a thousand footsteps so loud it shook the earth. Shouting and chaos, I froze in shear fright to people shooting and cutting. I drew enough to of seen the subject of the commotion.
Standing there was the most beautiful young women, she must have been 19 as she was the most beautiful person from here to anywhere that I know or seen. Dressed like a Warrior Princess whose decoration I had never seen before. Not envying her position at all, with men of 100 swords and more running to support. They thrusted their swords and charged all at once, I was so scared I closed my eyes. Reluctantly my eyes drew sight again, to my amazement this young warrior stood over the first line, then another charge and her sword I rememberd it well. Clapping like thunder her sword fanned all that stood before her until a line was given for the support to fire their guns. Gasping in shear panic, I clinched to the crackling sound of gunfire. My memory here is a bit foggy still, forgive me if what I say next gives insult, I mean no disrespect for what I have seen. But if it is this Covid thing you wanted to know well, this young warrior I recalled faced every bullet and when they reloaded the second time. To my amazement she flew into the sky, so high I thought she was a dragon brought down from the heavens as her komodo belt dragged along so high that it froze time itself. Just as quickly as she flew up, so did she roar of a Giant whale splitting the sky, downwards with a smash so great it drew the air from every place breaking the entire rank of their regiment lines.
I wanted to tell her "RUN", but quickly stopped myself in haste to tramping of more men coming towards for support.
To my mamazement she rested her blade across her shoulder and calmly moved to the fruit stall which was at the corner of the market square. Sheathing her sword back in, she drew herself to that warrior compojure and reached for a fruit from the empty stand.
I never seen anyone so happy in all my life as she laughed and waited to be swarmed by so many soldiers, like a swarm of insects for which I fatefully knew would be her end.
The silence of everyone shocked to the pile of bodies before them. Broken by the charging shouting they ran to envelope her like a hungry beast.
For a moment everything changed, from where the warrior was positioned a bright light blasted out so bright it burnt, everything and so loud that it broke my hearing and as you can see my last gift of sight.
The last thing I saw in the world that day was probably your Covid for which took my eyes away.
Wow, the young Sarsen gasped. So the tale is true, time did freeze from the moment when Nagasaki fell for the Great End. A chance to of been witness to a sight, even if the vision was hard to hear held together by the softness of her wise nature. Just having to know the tales are true, in a world of lies and missed truths, would have been everything if nothing just for a brief view.
